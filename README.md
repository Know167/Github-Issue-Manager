# Project Github Issue Manager

**Description:**
This personal project leverages Next.js to create a feature-rich issue manager for GitHub repositories. The goal is to enhance project management by providing a structured approach to handling issues.  One of the standout features is the ability to generate a JSON tree for issues, which visually tracks and connects each issue to related ones. This helps in organizing and managing projects more effectively, turning what would be big, meaningless clusters of issues into a structured and understandable format. The combination of Next.js for robust, server-rendered React applications and Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design makes this issue tracker an efficient tool for project management.

**Key Features:**
- Create and manage GitHub issues within a Next.js environment.
- Generate a JSON tree for visualizing relationships among issues.
- Improve project management by organizing and tracking related issues.
- Utilizes Redux store for state management.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js
- Redux
- Tailwind CSS

**How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application with `npm run dev`.

**Usage:**
1. Navigate to the application in your web browser.
2. Create new issues and observe the dynamic JSON tree.
3. Streamline project management by visualizing and tracking interconnected issues.
